### The core idea that holds it together
One **`ProfileResult` seam** (`@vhpce/profile-schema`). Two producers — the in-browser
**model** (`@vhpce/perf-models`) and **measured** runs (the gateway → Docker containers) — feed the
same charts, metrics, and deterministic explanations. Swapping the data source changes nothing
downstream. As of the Cloud Phase, *both* measured producers (fixed flagship kernels and arbitrary
Playground code) go through one async backend; **Model mode is the only offline path.**

---

## 2. What's built (concise)

- **Introduction** (`/intro`) — the front door: the one big idea (model vs. measured), and a
  guided map of every section with what it does and how long it takes. No backend.
- **Start Here** (`/start`) — three live runs on real cores that tell the whole story in five
  minutes: parallel works (`hello`), the naive sum doesn't scale (atomic synchronization
  bottleneck), and the one-line fix (reduction) does. Each step is a **predict-before-you-run**
  — guess the speedup before hitting Run, then compare to the measured result.
- **Learn the Basics** (`/learn`) — a beginner on-ramp (no backend, offline): six animated concept
  cards for **how OpenMP & MPI actually work** — fork–join, parallel-for loop splitting, shared vs
  private (race→reduction), MPI ranks & separate memory, send/recv, and collectives (bcast/scatter/
  gather/reduce). Each has a Canvas2D animation, an annotated code snippet, play/step controls, and a
  plain-language caption, plus a key-terms glossary. Pure teaching (no code executed) — the on-ramp
  *before* the "why it gets slower" Flagship. Each card **links onward** (the learning journey):
  OpenMP cards → a runnable Playground example (`/playground?ex=…`), MPI cards → the measured
  Flagship experiment (`/?exp=mpiHalo`).
- **Command Reference** (`/reference`) — a searchable, filterable library of **OpenMP, MPI & OpenACC
  directives/commands** (~190 entries: OpenMP 72 / MPI 59 / OpenACC 27 — incl. OpenMP `target`
  offloading + advanced (metadirective/declare variant) + runtime env; MPI one-sided RMA (+ shared
  windows), parallel I/O, neighborhood collectives, persistent requests, graph topologies, dynamic
  processes), each with a "smart" looping animation, syntax, a
  plain-English summary, a "good to know" note, hover-glossary `<Term>`s, related links (cross-tech
  navigation resets the filter), and a "▶ Run in the Playground" link where it maps to a runnable
  example. **Archetype-driven**: **14** reusable Canvas animations (`reference/archetypes.ts`) — incl.
  OpenACC `offload` (host↔device), `accData` (copyin/out/create/present/update), and `gangs`
  (gang/worker/vector) — + a data table (`reference/entries.ts`) where each entry maps to an
  archetype + params, so coverage grows by adding *data*, not code. Deep-linkable via
  `/reference?id=<entryId>`. The selected entry follows the active filter/search. A **C | Fortran**
  toggle shows each signature in both languages (derived: `!$omp`/`!$acc` sentinels + `end` directives,
  `for`→`do`; MPI `call …(…, ierror)` with Fortran type names — overridable via `signatureF`).
  A **★ Essentials** filter narrows the full library to the must-knows for newcomers.
- **Heat Lab** (`/lab`) — an interactive **2-D heat-equation** mini-lab (P5 domain module): an explicit
  finite-difference (FTCS Jacobi) stencil on a 128×128 grid, animated as a heatmap (offline, no
  backend). Controls: play/step/reset, diffusivity α (with a visible α≤0.25 stability cliff), speed.
  A **domain-decomposition overlay** (none / OpenMP / MPI / GPU) shows how the same stencil splits —
  OpenMP shared rows, MPI blocks + **halo rings** (links to the MPI Halo Exchange experiment), GPU
  tiles. Picking a model also swaps in the **actual stencil code** for it (serial → `omp parallel for`
  → `MPI_Sendrecv` halo exchange → CUDA kernel) with links to the matching Reference entry + Flagship
  experiment — the direct tie from the picture to real OpenMP/MPI/GPU code. A live **convergence
  plot** (log-scale max |Δu| per step) shows the solver converging — and **diverging** (red) when α>0.25.
- **Flagship** (`/`) — **nine experiments** (false sharing, synchronization, bandwidth saturation,
  load imbalance, MPI halo exchange, GPU occupancy, GPU coalescing, GPU divergence, GPU atomics),
  each with: model + **measured** data behind a **Model | Measured** toggle; a deterministic
  what/why/how/expected diagnosis; a **2D | 3D** visualization toggle; D3 scaling chart (+
  roofline for bandwidth, occupancy chart for CUDA). The scaling axis generalizes to **ranks** for
  MPI (`ExperimentResult.xUnits`); weak scaling uses scaled-speedup/efficiency in `buildResult`.
- **MPI Halo Exchange** — a 1-D Jacobi stencil with ring halo exchange, swept across ranks.
  The **strong vs weak** toggle is the lesson: strong (fixed grid) saturates as the comm fraction
  grows; weak (grid ∝ ranks) holds efficiency near ideal. Measured: `{kind:"mpi"}` → `vhpce-mpi`.
- **GPU Occupancy** — a CUDA kernel swept across **threads/block (32→1024)** on the **RTX 5060**,
  with a **light vs heavy register** toggle. Heavy is register-limited (~33% occupancy); light
  reaches ~100%. Occupancy is real — queried via the CUDA Occupancy API on the device. `{kind:"cuda"}`.
- **GPU Coalescing** — stride sweep (1→32) exposing the memory-transaction cost of non-contiguous
  warp access. Measured on the RTX 5060; model uses the transaction-count formula.
- **GPU Divergence** — branch-path sweep (1→16) exposing warp serialization cost. Measured;
  model uses the serialized-fraction formula.
- **GPU Atomics** — concurrent-target sweep (1→24) exposing contention on shared-memory atomics.
  Measured; model uses the queuing formula.
- **Compare** (`/compare`) — the same kernel through both producers at once: textbook model (dashed)
  overlaid on the measured run on real silicon (solid), with scenario knobs to see exactly where the
  napkin math and the hardware agree — and where they diverge.
- **Ask the AI** (`apps/web/src/app/api/ask/route.ts` + `AskAI.tsx`) — optional Claude panel
  (`claude-opus-4-8`, streaming), **grounded on the deterministic findings**; key via
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or a per-tab bring-your-own key; built-in explanations always on.
- **Code Playground** (`/playground`) — Monaco editor → compile + thread-sweep arbitrary OpenMP C
  in a **locked-down Docker container** (11 worked examples, deep-linkable via `?ex=<id>`).
  **predict-before-you-run** (guess your speedup, then see the real numbers); **plain-language
  diagnostics** with "what now?" routing to the exact Flagship experiment that explains the
  bottleneck; **thread-count explorer** (per-point breakdown); opt-in **cachegrind** cache-miss
  profiling (D1/LLd miss rates).
- **Play** (`/play`) — the fun-first corner: **⚡ Race** pits two kernel variants head-to-head
  (predict the winner, then run both); **🧩 Quiz** tests your bottleneck instincts;
  **🔬 Sandbox** lets you explore Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws interactively; **🏅 Badges**
  rewards correct predictions across Start, Playground, and Flagship experiments and tracks
  prediction streaks.
- **Cloud gateway** (`services/api`) — **FastAPI + Redis + Arq**, run via `docker-compose`. The
  Flagship's Measured mode and the Playground both **submit jobs and poll**: `POST /api/jobs`
  (`{kind:"bench"|"code", ...}`) → `GET /api/jobs/{id}`. The Arq worker (`max_jobs=1`, serialized for
  clean timing) mounts the host Docker socket and spawns sibling sandbox containers —
  **`vhpce-bench`** (the four fixed kernels, pre-compiled) and **`vhpce-runner`** (untrusted code,
  locked down). Fixed-kernel results are cached in Redis. The old stdlib runner (`server.py`) is
  **retired**; `experiments/bench.c` lives on as the `vhpce-bench` source.

## 3. Current app state — how to run

**Environment (this machine):** Windows 11; WSL2 Ubuntu (24 logical cores); **RTX 5060 Laptop**
(CUDA passthrough works in WSL); Docker Desktop (WSL integration on); Node 24 (Windows-native) +
pnpm 11; Next.js **16** / React 19 / Tailwind v4.

```powershell
# --- Cloud gateway (needed for Measured mode + the Playground; Docker Desktop must be running) ---
# 1) build the sandbox images (tags vhpce-bench + vhpce-runner) — one-time / after kernel changes:
docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml --profile build build
# 2) start redis + api + worker:
docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml up -d                               # api -> :8000, redis -> :6379
#    logs / stop:
docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml logs -f
docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml down

# --- Web app (Next 16) ---
# PATH note: spawned shells here inherit a stale PATH; refresh before node/pnpm:
$env:Path="$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine'));$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User'))"
pnpm --filter web dev                                                          # -> http://localhost:3000
# Preview/launch config alternative (.claude/launch.json "web") uses absolute node.exe + Next bin,
# because the preview spawner lacks node on PATH.
```

- **Ports:** web `:3000`, gateway api `:8000`, redis `:6379`. Browser reaches the gateway at
  `http://localhost:8000` (override with `NEXT_PUBLIC_VHPCE_API`).
- **Routes:** `/intro` (Introduction — orientation), `/start` (Start Here — guided first runs),
  `/learn` (Basics — concept animations), `/reference` (command library — offline),
  `/lab` (Heat-equation mini-lab — offline), `/` (Flagship — 9 experiments),
  `/compare` (model vs measured overlay), `/playground` (Code Playground),
  `/play` (Play hub — Race game + more), `POST|GET /api/ask` (LLM, Next route).
  Gateway: `GET /api/health`, `POST /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/{id}`.
- **Ask-the-AI:** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `apps/web/.env.local` (then restart) **or** paste a key
  in the panel (kept per-tab only).

## 6. Next implementation steps

The core product and engagement layer are complete. Candidate next steps:

1. **Engineering-domain modules (P5).** FEM/FDTD/CFD/stencil/FFT mini-labs with interactive
   domain decomposition and convergence plots, built on the same `ProfileResult` seam and the
   gateway job kinds (OpenMP/MPI/CUDA) already in place.

3. **Classrooms + true cloud scale (P5).** Multi-user — raise the worker's `max_jobs` / add
   replicas (the queue already supports it), move sandboxes to K8s Jobs, and unlock **true PMU
   counters** (perf/LIKWID) on a bare-metal/cloud node (WSL2 has no host PMU; cachegrind + the
   CUDA Occupancy API are the local stand-ins). LMS integration for classroom deployments.

---

## 7. Gotchas worth remembering (hit during P0–P2)

- **Canvas/SVG ignore CSS `var()`** — use literal hex/JS palette in `viz`/canvas code, not `var(--x)`.
- **`next/dynamic({ssr:false})` under a conditional mount** caused a React "useEffect deps changed
  size" error — use a **static import** for client-only components (R3F scenes are client-safe via effects).
- **Cachegrind** needs `--cache-sim=yes` (off by default in modern valgrind); summary spacing is
  `D1  miss rate` (two spaces), `I refs` (one space).
- **Stop the gateway** with `docker compose -f infra/docker/compose.yml down` (no more
  `pkill python3` — the stdlib runner is gone). Rebuild the sandbox images after editing `bench.c`
  or a Dockerfile: `docker compose ... --profile build build`.
- **Docker-out-of-Docker works on Docker Desktop:** the api/worker bind-mount
  `/var/run/docker.sock` and `docker run` siblings against the host daemon — verified even with WSL
  integration *off* (compose talks to the Linux engine, which owns the socket). Build needs internet
  (static docker client + pip + apt).
- **PowerShell wraps native stderr as `NativeCommandError`** — `docker build`/`up` print progress to
  stderr, which shows as red "RemoteException" lines even on success; trust `$LASTEXITCODE`, not the
  red text.
- **Preview screenshots can time out on the flagship** (the R3F animation loop keeps the renderer
  busy). Verify with `preview_eval` (read DOM/state, fetch the gateway) instead of `preview_screenshot`.
- **Model mode is the only offline path now** — Measured (both producers) needs the gateway + Docker.
- **MPI weak scaling needs a compute-bound kernel.** A plain memory-bound stencil makes ranks
  contend for shared DRAM bandwidth on one node, so weak scaling *degrades* (the opposite of the
  lesson). `halo.c` adds a per-cell arithmetic chain (`FLOP`) to push it compute-bound → weak stays
  ~flat. (The model carries the clean comm-wall lesson; measured shows this node's reality.)
- **`mpirun` launches occasionally stall.** `mpi-driver.sh` wraps each launch in `timeout -k 5 45`
  and uses `--bind-to none`, with a prev-value fallback so a missed point never emits `ms:0`
  (which would divide-by-zero the speedup). Without the per-launch cap a single stall ate the whole
  300s job timeout.
- **`vhpce-mpi`'s ENTRYPOINT is the driver**, not the kernel: args are `<mode> <maxranks> <Nbase>
  <iters>` — don't confuse with `halo`'s `<mode> <Nbase> <iters>` (passing maxranks=Nbase launches a
  runaway sweep).
- **`--network none` is fine for single-node MPI** — OpenMPI uses the loopback/shared-memory
  transport, which works inside the locked-down container (verified).
- **GPU passes into containers** via `docker run --gpus all` (Docker Desktop has the `nvidia` runtime
  registered; the RTX 5060 shows up as cc 12.0 / sm_120 inside the container). The locked-down flags
  (`--cap-drop ALL --network none --read-only` + tmpfs `/tmp`) coexist with `--gpus all`; CUDA's JIT
  cache needs a writable dir → `CUDA_CACHE_PATH=/tmp/.nv`.
- **sm_120 (Blackwell) needs a recent toolkit.** `cuda.Dockerfile` tries `nvcc -arch=sm_120` and falls
  back to `compute_90` **PTX** (the new driver JITs it forward to sm_120). The CUDA **Occupancy API**
  queries the real device, so measured occupancy is accurate regardless of the compile arch.
- **The CUDA devel image is ~5–7 GB** (one-time pull, several minutes). Occupancy is real (Occupancy
  API); Nsight Compute counters on WSL2 remain future work.
- **GPU occupancy needs its own chart** (`drawOccupancy`) and result builder — block size (32→1024)
  is a different x-domain than threads/ranks (1→24), so the cuda experiment does **not** use
  `buildResult` (mirrors how bandwidth has the roofline).
- **Spawned PowerShell inherits a stale PATH** — refresh from registry before `node`/`pnpm`
  (snippet in §3). The preview launch config uses absolute `node.exe` + Next's bin for the same reason.
- **`.gitattributes` forces LF** so `bench-driver.sh`/Dockerfile stay LF (CRLF breaks the container entrypoint).
- **Docker `/health` can briefly read "not ready"** while Docker Desktop starts/auto-updates — the
  Playground Run button is intentionally not hard-gated on it.
- **WSL2 has no host PMU** — measured cache counters come from **cachegrind (simulated)**; true
  `perf`/LIKWID counters are a bare-metal/cloud concern.
